# ImageSegmentation
Image segmentation on GrapesNet datset
## GrapesNet Dataset
GrapesNet dataset has been proposed which includes 4 different datasets of grape bunches of vineyard and are listed below:
1. Dataset-1: RGB images with one grape bunch per image with black background and one
grape bunch per image with natural background
2. Dataset-2: RGB images with two or more grape bunches per image with natural background
3. Dataset-3: RGB-D images of vineyard with real environmental conditions
4. Dataset-4: RGB-D images with one grape bunch per image with experimental environment
with coral background for grape weight prediction task
